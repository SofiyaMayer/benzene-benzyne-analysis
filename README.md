# Benzene-Benzyne Quantum Chemistry Analysis

This repository contains a **quantum-chemical study** of benzene and benzyne using **Hartree-Fock (HF), MP2, and B3LYP** methods with the **6-31G*** basis set. The study includes **molecular geometry optimization, bond length and angle comparisons, SCF energy calculations, infrared (IR) spectra analysis, and thermodynamic property evaluations**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the structural and electronic properties of benzene and benzyne through:
- **Molecular geometry optimization** using HF, MP2, and B3LYP methods.
- **Comparison of bond lengths and bond angles** between benzene and benzyne.
- **SCF total energy calculations** to evaluate stability differences.
- **Infrared (IR) spectra analysis** to identify characteristic vibrational modes.
- **Hydrogenation enthalpy and Gibbs free energy calculations** to assess thermodynamic properties.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods Used
- **Molecules modeling:** Molden
- **Quantum Chemistry Software:** ORCA
- **Computational Methods:** HF, MP2, and B3LYP

## 📊 Key Findings
- The **presence of a triple bond in benzyne** disrupts molecular symmetry, leading to shorter C≡C bond lengths (~1.22–1.27 Å) and elongated adjacent single bonds (~1.39–1.45 Å).
- **Benzene exhibits a fully delocalized aromatic structure** with uniform C–C bond lengths (~1.39–1.41 Å) and bond angles close to 120°.
- **SCF energy calculations** confirm that benzene is more stable than benzyne, with an energy difference of approximately **35 eV**.
- **Infrared spectral analysis** identifies a **C≡C stretching vibration at ~3214 cm⁻¹** in benzyne, while benzene lacks this feature and instead exhibits **C–H stretching vibrations** in the same region.
- **Hydrogenation Gibbs free energy calculations** indicate that the reaction is **spontaneous under standard conditions**.
